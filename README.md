# TheOdinProject
All my Odin Project stuff.

I will keep this updated as I advance through the course, for personal satisfaction and also in case anyone is interested on seeing real progress from someone that is going to take the full Odin Project course.

-------------------PROGRESS---------------------

DAY 1: Completed 4 modules of the Foundations Course. I can now understand how a .html file should look like, as well as how to add a title, a header, some text, images and even links. I also learned how to keep my website folder clean and organized for me and other people to understand. I learned that html tags also have "arguments" that must be included in certain cases for different reasons. Of course, I also checked most of the pages that The Odin Project recommeds to learn even more things. 

On the other side, I learned how to use the terminal to create, delete and modify files and directories, as well as some pretty useful commands that I'll keep using on further lessons.

Lastly, I learned the basics of Git, which is why I can see this written on GitHub (which is not the same as Git!). I can have different versions of my code in case anything happens, since I can delete stuff without even noticing thanks to my lack of knowledge on terminal commands. Even though I already knew most of this stuff, I still learned some tricks and little things.

DAY 2: Completed the basic section of HTML by doing the "recipes" project (which you can find on the Projects folder). I've wrote more about that project on the README.md file that is located inside the folder of the project. However, something interesting I might do later is creating a website on this main directory so it can be my index and then putting all my projects there so anyone can see the projects in a single page. I'll do that later as I want it to look as good as possible, and I guess I'll have to rename some files for it to have a correct structure, but I will probably do that in the future.

It was a short day as I didn't notice it was the end of the HTML section, so I'll start the CSS section on day 3, as I think I deserve a little break and I'll practice my HTML for a little bit on my own!

DAY 3: I finished the basic CSS module with all of the exercises completed (which are on their own repo, you can find it on my GitHub profile). Learned about general styling using CSS, how specificity works and the difference between a type, class and id. I also learned how to make my code shorter by giving common styling to some elements and then specifying later the design of other elements. I understand as well about the parent/children relation on CSS. As the final part of this module, I have the "odin recipes" page some style with external CSS, as internal and inline will be used later (I think).

DAY 4 - 5: I forgot to comment on my progress on day 4. Basically I finished the whole flexbox section of the course, doing all the different tasks that The Odin Project offers. On day 5 specifically I started working on my Landing Page (which you can find on my Github pages and also as a repo) and succesfully finished it on day 6 basically since it's quite early in the morning. So far I'm super happy of my progress since I didn't have many problems when doing the Landing Page. I think I still have to practice my Flexbox skills, but that'll take time of course.

DAY 6: I went through most of the Javascript sections. I can now do full conditional statemets with the different types of operators as well. I didn't update this repo with much code since all the practice was made on several websites, but I hope tomorrow I will add some cool code with a full project! Also, I read a bit on my own and learned some cool tricks on HTML and CSS.
