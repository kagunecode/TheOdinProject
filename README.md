# TheOdinProject
All my Odin Project stuff.

I will keep this updated as I advance through the course, for personal satisfaction and also in case anyone is interested on seeing real progress from someone that is going to take the full Odin Project course.

PROGRESS

DAY 1: Completed 4 modules of the Foundations Course. I can now understand how a .html file should look like, as well as how to add a title, a header, some text, images and even links. I also learned how to keep my website folder clean and organized for me and other people to understand. I learned that html tags also have "arguments" that must be included in certain cases for different reasons. Of course, I also checked most of the pages that The Odin Project recommeds to learn even more things. 

On the other side, I learned how to use the terminal to create, delete and modify files and directories, as well as some pretty useful commands that I'll keep using on further lessons.

Lastly, I learned the basics of Git, which is why I can see this written on GitHub (which is not the same as Git!). I can have different versions of my code in case anything happens, since I can delete stuff without even noticing thanks to my lack of knowledge on terminal commands. Even though I already knew most of this stuff, I still learned some tricks and little things.
