# TheOdinProject
All my Odin Project stuff.

I will keep this updated as I advance through the course, for personal satisfaction and also in case anyone is interested on seeing real progress from someone that is going to take the full Odin Project course.

PROGRESS

DAY 1: Completed 4 modules of the Foundations Course. I can now understand how a .html file should look like, as well as how to add a title, a header, some text, images and even links. I also learned how to keep my website folder clean and organized for me and other people to understand. I learned that html tags also have "arguments" that must be included in certain cases for different reasons. Of course, I also checked most of the pages that The Odin Project recommeds to learn even more things. 

On the other side, I learned how to use the terminal to create, delete and modify files and directories, as well as some pretty useful commands that I'll keep using on further lessons.

Lastly, I learned the basics of Git, which is why I can see this written on GitHub (which is not the same as Git!). I can have different versions of my code in case anything happens, since I can delete stuff without even noticing thanks to my lack of knowledge on terminal commands. Even though I already knew most of this stuff, I still learned some tricks and little things.

DAY 2: Completed the basic section of HTML by doing the "recipes" project (which you can find on the Projects folder). I've wrote more about that project on the README.md file that is located inside the folder of the project. However, something interesting I might do later is creating a website on this main directory so it can be my index and then putting all my projects there so anyone can see the projects in a single page. I'll do that later as I want it to look as good as possible, and I guess I'll have to rename some files for it to have a correct structure, but I will probably do that in the future.

It was a short day as I didn't notice it was the end of the HTML section, so I'll start the CSS section on day 3, as I think I deserve a little break and I'll practice my HTML for a little bit on my own!
