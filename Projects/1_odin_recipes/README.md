So this is my first full HTML project.

So far, I've learned the basics of HTML and tags, as well as some arguments that I should get used to for having good code. I've also learned some stuff about Git and GitHub, which are not the same by any means, but that together work for version control which can be super handy specially when dealing with changing code and messing around with stuff.
I've also learned how to use the Linux terminal to do some pretty awesome tasks in a more efficient and correct way (which I've been doing so far). I hope this project goes as planned!

Once I finished this project I could really see I've learned a lot, though there's plenty more to learn. I'm already familiar with the structure of a webpage folder with all pages and images on their own folders, and I guess there will be more types of files to work with in the future. Also, I've learned how to use some of the most basic HTML tags. I can add a link on each page to return to the main page, but I prefer to do that in a later project since I want to know what's the best way to do this to do things right.

I didn't publish this website on the solutions section of The Odin Project, but I will post the projects I consider as "my best" ones at the end! Maybe It'll be a nice idea to make a single website that contains every single project.

DAY 3: Used some CSS to give proper styling to all the different pages. Added a "Return Home" button as well as a footer to add the link to my GitHub profile.
