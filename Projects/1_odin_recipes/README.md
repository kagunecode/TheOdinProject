So this is my first full HTML project.

So far, I've learned the basics of HTML and tags, as well as some arguments that I should get used to for having good code. I've also learned some stuff about Git and GitHub, which are not the same by any means, but that together work for version control which can be super handy specially when dealing with changing code and messing around with stuff.
I've also learned how to use the Linux terminal to do some pretty awesome tasks in a more efficient and correct way (which I've been doing so far). I hope this project goes as planned!
