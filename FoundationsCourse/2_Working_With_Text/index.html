        <h1>Starting my journey on The Odin Project!</h1>
        <p>This is a pretty cool thing to do and I'm quite excited about it.</p>
        <p>I want to learn <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> about web design.
        Of course, <em>this is not that easy...</em> so this will take some time.
        But I will learn a lot and make progress because I can do it!</p>
        <h2>How much time will this take?</h2>
        <p>Much likely <strong>A LOT</strong>. But it would be boring if it was too easy.</p>
        <h3>VSCode has a command for generating dummy text!</h3>
        <p>By writing "lorem" I'll get the full dummy text automatically. So cool.</p>
